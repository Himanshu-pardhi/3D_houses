Project : 3D_houses

Deadline : 20/06/22 16:30 PM

To model any house located in Flanders in 3D with only a home address

Learning Objectives
. to be able to search and implement new libraries
. to be able to read and use the shapefile format
. to be able to read and use geoTIFFs
. to be able to render a 3D plot
. to be able to present a final product

The Mission
We are LIDAR PLANES, active in the Geospatial industry. We would like to use our data to launch a new branch in the insurance business. So, we need you to build a solution with our data to model a house in 3D with only a home address.

Must-have features
3D lookup of houses.

Nice-to-have features
Optimize your solution to have the result as fast as possible.
Features like the living area of the house in mÂ², how many floors, if there is a pool, the vegetation in the neighborhood, etc...
Better visualization.


Miscellaneous information
What is LIDAR ?
LIDAR is a method to measure distance using light. The device will illuminate a target with a laser light and a sensor will measure the reflection. Differences in wavelength and return times will be used to get 3D representations of an area.
